<p class='pindent'>I know where there is a poppy-bed by a broken
fence, and a house belonging to the poppy-bed, where
old Mrs. Pike lives. Mrs. Pike can neither read nor
write, but she commands respect, and her face is eloquent
with the wisdom of many years. I know a little
one-roomed cottage where Jim Savery’s wife rears her
children. The chairs are rough-hewn by hand and the
legs are unequal. Jim is a fisherman, like all his neighbors,
and his cod lie drying on the frames outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I know a tumble-down gray house, sixty years old,
whose owner will never again repair it, but will live in it
until it falls. He has a boy of twelve who gets up before
light to study his lessons, when he hears his father going
out to his nets. Once his father drifted in a small boat
three days and nights, among the ice floes, in a dense
fog, without food or water. The man with him died of
the cold and lay frozen stiff in the bottom of the boat.
All night long, before that man died, he lay beside him
in the boat, clasping him in his arms, trying to keep the
vital spark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I know where a wooden cross stands in memory of
a clergyman who went in a storm to visit a sick man on
an island near the coast. He promised his wife he would
return that night, and he started home, but perished in
the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I know the way over the sharp rocks two miles to
“Mother Legg’s Brook,” where are, perhaps, four little
dwellings. Why any one should choose to build there
is inexplicable. Why they remain is not so puzzling;
they are too poor to move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These things come before me in pictures as I recall
Newfoundland. Again I breathe the clear, cold, exhilarating
air and tread the flinty roads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had come up through beautiful Cape Breton
Island, with its rich meadows, orchards and forests of
pine, and its far-reaching, wonderful Bras D’Or Lakes.
It was a dark night and raining hard when we reached
North Sydney and stepped on board the steamer “Bruce”,
which seemed to fold strong arms around us as she carried
us through the great rolling billows, over a hundred
miles of ocean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the morning was clear, and a rocky shore loomed
up before us--the Newfoundland of our dreams!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The white rocks were almost dazzling in the sunshine,
with scant herbage in the crevices, and here and
there where foothold could be found a fisherman’s cottage
perched like a bird resting in its flight. The air
was crystal clear, and the sky the bluest ever seen. We
glided into a harbor which wound like a river between
jagged precipices, and then the “Bruce” reached her
wharf, and all the passengers but three hastened to
board the train for St. John’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A twenty minutes’ walk along a rugged path, much
of it the exposed surface of solid rock, brought us to
Channel, a typical fishing village, like which there are
scores along the deeply indented coast of Newfoundland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is said that Newfoundland resembles Norway.
Its deep bays, guarded by lofty cliffs, are like the Norwegian
fiords. Some of these bays run inland eighty or
ninety miles, with the wildest and grandest of scenery.
In the interior of the island are boundless forests of
pine, fir, spruce and birch. They are almost entirely
untraversed, though the railroad passes through them,
and hunters camp by the lakes. Many of the interior
stations set down on the railroad map consist, we were
told, only of a platform and a pine tree or a telegraph
pole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the western side are mountain ranges clothed
with evergreens and maples, and between those and the
Gulf are fertile farm lands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are copper and iron mines on the island,
which are being developed, so that fishing is not now
the only industry, though it is the most absorbing and
the most prominent. It holds the attention at every
point of the coast. Often there are hamlets only a mile
apart, yet it may be impossible to go from one to the
other except by a boat. When we found that Rose
Blanche, a very picturesque village, was only four miles
“as the crow flies” from Channel, where we were staying,
we proposed to walk there, but were met by looks
and exclamations of utter amazement from the fishermen,
and we were soon convinced that we could never
cross the precipices and ravines that lay between.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Channel has but a few hundred inhabitants, its roads
are hard and narrow, untraveled by so much as an ox-cart,
and horses and carriages are unknown. Sheep
meet the wanderer on these paths and turn aside for
him with a gentle start of surprise. The roads are laid
out something like a bow-knot with several ends, and on
one of the loops looking down sheer upon wave-beaten
boulders, we found a house where we could stay, kept
by a widow who had not much more than a measure of
meal and a cruse of oil among her supplies, but who did
her best. She sent her son to the “Bruce” with a
wheelbarrow, to get our extension bag, but there was
absolutely no way of transporting our trunk, so that as
long as we remained in Channel, if we wanted anything
from the trunk, we had to walk two miles to get it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dropping our wraps in our landlady’s neat spare
room, we started gaily out, enjoying the sound of our
own steps on the hard road bed, and bracing ourselves
against the strong clean wind. Everything was strange
to us, and we found our first common interest in a bed
of red poppies by a slanting fence. There we stopped,
and were glad when we saw a woman stepping out from
her door to see who we were. It was Mrs. Pike, and on
her invitation we entered her tidy kitchen and rested by
the fire while she related to us the story of her son’s
voyages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next we made the acquaintance of the postmaster,
who invited us to call on his wife at “Willow House,”
so named from the row of light green willows planted
along his fence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On leaving him and returning along the ledge-like
path we met the stipendiary magistrate, who greeted us
because we were strangers, and introduced us to a great
telegraph magnate, Mr. A. M. Mackay, who was stopping
over a few hours to catch a coast steamer. He
told us he had three times, before the completion of the
railroad, crossed the island from Port-au-Basques to St.
John’s on foot (which was really the only way he <span class='it'>could</span>
go), a distance of 548 miles, living upon what game he
could secure as he went along. His object in this
arduous trip was to locate the Anglo-American Telegraph
Company’s line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In conversation with Mr. Mackay and the stipendiary
magistrate, we gained some knowledge of the politics
and government of Newfoundland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Newfoundland is a country by itself, owning allegiance
to King Edward VII., it is true, but having its
own government and making its own laws. It is so distinct
from Canada that it is regarded as a foreign country,
and goods passing between the two are as strictly examined
as if between England and France. Government
has not been indulgent to the fishermen, who form so
large a part of the population. They have not been allowed
to take up or occupy the more fertile and productive
parts of the country, but have been compelled to seek
their shelter among the rocks, like the conies, and no
way is open to them to gain a living except by the catching
and salting of codfish, herring and salmon nine
months in the year, and by perilous sealing trips in
the winter among the ice floes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Formerly they took their own fish to other places to
sell, making trips to Halifax, Boston or New York,
and some adventurous sailors even carried ship loads
annually to Italy, just before Lent, bringing back good
pay and cargoes of oil and salt. In those days they
could bring their own supplies from the ports they visited,
and a very simple shop or two in each village was
enough. But the keen eye of the speculator was upon
them. The merchant, a new factor, made his appearance.
The merchant came into the village, with means
at command, and built warehouses and a wharf, and had
his own vessels. He brought in staple articles of all
kinds, groceries, cloth, shoes, coal--and then he took
pay for these in codfish. This saved the fishermen all
trouble in marketing their catches; they had only to
fish and take what they caught and cured to the convenient
merchant, instead of across the seas to Italy or
down to the States. If they had a bad season, the merchant
trusted them, and they could pay when they had
better luck. Of course he paid something less than
they could get by going farther, but they saved time and
stayed nearer home. So they fell easily into the new
way, and dropped the habit of going abroad, having this
ready purchaser at their door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bye and bye prices were not so good for fish, and
now and then groceries went up a little. The people
awoke too late to the situation. They had lost their
markets. Simple as their wants had always been, they
were now more pinched than ever before, and there was
nothing to do but to go on fishing, always fishing, that
they might get flour, molasses, clothing, coal, from the
ever accommodating merchant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Channel is a fair sample of the larger coast villages.
Its merchant has a comfortable house and a well-filled
store. His yard is well fenced, and there his only child,
a little daughter, plays alone. She is not allowed the
companionship of the fishermen’s children, and when
she is older she will have a governess. Other children
attend the Church of England school or the Methodist
school, the Roman Catholic children remaining outside
until after prayers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fishermen live in small, poor cottages, with the
barest necessities of life. As you meet them on the
road or shore and look at their weather-beaten, serious
faces and their friendly, inquiring eyes, you are touched
with the pathos of their condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The merchant is not the only well-to-do man in
Channel. The government has its salaried officials
there also, the stipendiary magistrate, who can offer his
guests cake and wine, the constable, who has charge
of the empty prison, patrols the paths, and takes command
in cases of shipwreck, and the postmaster, who
for thirty years has lived there comfortably and raised
a large family of sons and daughters. He told us that
it had been his custom at the beginning of each winter
to lay in ten barrels of flour and a whole frozen ox.
These men support the government policy and seek no
changes. They are good in their place and earn their
salaries, but their lot is immeasureably easier than that
of the fishermen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The school teacher gets a little pay from the government
and a little from each family, probably not
more than three hundred dollars in all. The doctor
receives five dollars annually from each family, except
the very poorest, and for this sum he treats them in all
their illnesses. He is also the doctor for Codroy, Little
River, and one or two other places, on the same terms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no dentist or barber in Channel, and not
one saloon. It is a strict temperance place from force
of circumstances, and the roads are as safe at midnight
as at midday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are no lawyers there, but for the purposes of
justice the circuit court visits the place at intervals,
coming by boat. A curious case was being tried the day
of our arrival, and a crowd of boys were in attendance.
A certain boy had been made the subject of ridicule by
the others, who jeered at him and nicknamed him the
“Sheep.” The more he showed his resentment the
more they tormented him, and one boy went so far as to
call out “Ba-a-a! Ba-a-a!” when he met him on the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy who said “Ba-a-a!” was now on trial, his
offense was proved, and he was sentenced to jail for
thirty days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The jail is in the constable’s house, and when I was
calling there a few days later I was shown the cells,
which are simply three neat little bedrooms, and I saw
the jail yard, where the culprit was digging his bare toes
in the ground, with an embarrassed air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Public opinion was with him, because he was a poor
and honest boy who had just got a place to work, while
the “Sheep” was an arrogant boy home on a vacation
from a St. John’s school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The air at Channel is so crystal pure and bracing,
that it seems as if one living there need never be ill or
tired, but the water supply is poor and the wells are few
and shallow. That is a drawback. The merchant has
secured a good well, and another man has a cistern full
of rain water which he filters, but most of the people
depend on shallow wells. There is no depth of soil, and
where there is soil without drainage it is boggy. There
was a pretty house next the one where we stayed, with
a broad, green yard, but the owner told me that all the
earth had been brought in boat-loads from a river bank
some miles away. Although there are such limitless
forests in the interior, at Channel there are no trees except
the postmaster’s willows, and that is why the people
have to buy coal for fuel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the rocks, the air, the harbor, the sea, and the
waves dashing in foam over the bar, yield a fine exhilaration
and make one unwilling to leave Channel. The
people are so friendly that it is easy to become personally
acquainted with them. We were called “the Americans,”
and everyone was ready to stop and talk with us and to invite
us into their homes. My heart warms when I think
of them. There was the day when we visited the Methodist
school and saw a chalk line drawn on the floor
before the toes of the class which came up to recite.
After the recitation, the earnest young teacher asked us
for speeches, so we paid for our pleasure. At the Church
of England school we were much interested in the games
which the children played on the rocks in recess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am convinced that we burden ourselves with too
many luxuries. When we were calling on Jim Savery’s
wife, whose house has only one room, with a loft above,
where the family sleep, I glanced around and could not
see that any actual necessity of life was lacking. There
was a table and four home-made chairs, so that I could
imagine the family at meals, or the mother sewing and
the children studying their lessons. There was a good
stove, with kettle and tins, a chest to keep clothes in,
a few shelves in a corner, with notched paper and the
best dishes on them, and in another corner a closet,
which presumably held provisions. There was one lamp
and a spinning wheel. A bright little girl of four swung
on a chair-back watching us, and a tall boy stood in the
doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wish that you could see Jim Savery’s wife! She
might have stepped out from one of Millet’s best pictures.
She is a tall, strong woman, with noble features,
well browned, and carries herself grandly. She was
carding soft, white masses of wool, and after that she
began to spin, walking back and forth beside the wheel.
She was not born in Channel. She told us she came
from Codroy. She said Codroy was beautiful, with
trees and gardens--different from Channel. She had
been back once or twice to visit her folks there. In her
calm, benevolent countenance there was not a trace of
discontent, but I found myself wishing that she could
go to Codroy once every year when gardens were in
bloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When a little girl in Codroy, going to school, she
used to like the poems in the Reader. I asked her if
she could remember any of them, and stopping her
wheel she stood by it there in that little room and repeated
Wordsworth’s “We Are Seven.” Once or twice
she faltered, and the boy in the doorway prompted her
with the missing words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I go to Channel again I shall take as pretty a
plate as I can find with me, to exchange with Mrs.
Savery for one of hers. She has several white ones,
each with a highly colored picture in the centre, and the
one I desire is adorned with a figure dressed in bright red
and blue, with these words printed below: “A Lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our gentle, care-worn landlady, Mrs. Arnold, won
our respect and affection. Her pretty and ambitious
daughter, Bessie, was assistant teacher in the Church
of England school and the organist of the church on
Sunday. Every Sunday the first officer of the “Bruce”
came to spend the evening, part of the time singing
hymns while Bessie played, and part of the time telling
us tales of adventure such as we had never heard before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One afternoon, when we came in from a long walk,
expecting the usual supper of bread, tea and tart, we
were greeted by the appetizing smell of fresh cod fried
with onions. Two men had arrived to stay over night,
waiting for the coast steamer, and we all had supper
together. Those men told us the most interesting things.
Mr. McDougal said when he began sealing he could not
kill the first baby seal, because it cried so pitifully. He
picked it up and carried it to the boat, where another
man killed it. Sometimes, out in the ice, their hands
would get so cold that they had to thrust them inside a
freshly killed seal to warm them in its blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other man, Captain Smith, had been to the
same points on sea and shore where Captain Parry went
so many years ago. Once he steered his ship through
a narrow passage between two icebergs, and just as he
got through the whole mass lifted and proved to be all
one iceberg with two pinnacles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was present when Captain Buddington, of
Groton, took possession of the “Resolute,” and felt
chagrined because the American reached that vessel
first. He knew the Esquimaux that Captain Buddington
brought home, and himself once bought an Esquimau
boy for a penknife, intending to bring him
away, but repented at the last moment, thinking that
the boy’s life would be shortened in our climate, and so
set him ashore just before the ship started. The little
Esquimau was sadly disappointed, and looked after
them with longing eyes as they sailed away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is only a tithe of the stories those men told us
of their adventures on sea and land. Every fisherman
in Newfoundland has thrilling tales to tell, and every
number of the St. John’s newspaper has some account
of shipwreck or other tragedy, or some perilous deed of
daring and narrow escape to relate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the equinoctial caught us there at Channel,
and the wind blew so heavy a gale that we had to hold
to the fences if we ventured out of doors. The sea
dashed over the bar in mountains of white spray, and
the weather grew cold. Then we began to think of
home, and the homing instinct drew us to the “Bruce”
again. Again we trod the rocky road to Port-au-Basques,
while Clem, our landlady’s son, laboriously pushed the
wheelbarrow that held our baggage. Many of our new
friends accompanied us to the wharf for a last goodbye,
and then we were off, and next morning found us at
Cape Breton Island once more, taking another boat to
sail down the beautiful Bras D’Or lakes to Baddeck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this was a year and more ago. My heart turns
to Newfoundland, and I wish that I were there again.
The equinoctial should not frighten me away <span class='it'>this</span> time.
I would step ashore from the “Bruce” and speed over
the stony hills to our landlady’s home. I would go in
and say: “Do you remember me?” and we would breakfast
together on tea and porridge and brewis. Then I
would go out and make a round of calls, and hear the
news, and live the happy days over again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it takes three days and three nights to reach
Newfoundland. Fine, invisible barriers, woven by circumstances
and habit, by thrift and convenience, restrain
me. Telepathy is my resource. There is not a
day that I do not send kindly thoughts to Channel, and
sometimes it seems to me that a little kindly thought
from there comes fluttering back, and that I am not
forgotten.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
